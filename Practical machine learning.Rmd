# Introduction
In this report a model is build with the goal to predict the manner in which people did an exercise. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The data used comes from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

Described through this document is:
1. how the model is build
2. how cross validation is used
3. what the expected out of sample error is
4. why certain choices were made. 
5. predictions for 20 different test cases.

## Basic set up
Set seed for reproducible results, load needed libraries, and load needed data (trainingdata and predictiondata).

### set seed for reproducible results

```{r parameters, echo = T}
set.seed(1234)
```

### load libraries

```{r load libraries, echo = T}
library(readr)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(e1071)
library(doParallel)
```

### load data and keep only columns without NA's.
```{r loading data, echo =T }

trainingdata     <- read_csv("~/Algemeen/Personal Development/Dat science certification/pml-training.csv")
predictiondata   <- read_csv("~/Algemeen/Personal Development/Dat science certification/pml-testing.csv")

#do not use columns including na
trainingdata     <-trainingdata[,colSums(is.na(trainingdata)) == 0]
predictiondata     <-predictiondata[,colSums(is.na(predictiondata)) == 0]
```

## Building the model
The model is build with a 70% train set and a 30% test set, where only variables were used that do not contain NA's. The model predicts the variable classe.
Also, variables that are not predictors are deleted. 
Furthermore k-fold cross validation, where k is 4, was used, also using parallel processing to spered up the process.
In the process of corss validation also the train and test data sets where 70-30% and all variables were scaled and centered.
The algorithm used was a random forest and the performance metric Áccuracy'.


### only select variables that are predictors
```{r select vars, echo =T }
trainingdata_vars   <-trainingdata[,-c(1:7)]
prediction_vars    <-predictiondata[,-c(1:7)]
```

### set up train and test set with 70 - 30 % distirbution

```{r train test set, echo =T }
idtrain    <- createDataPartition(trainingdata_vars$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train     <- trainingdata_vars[idtrain,]
test      <- trainingdata_vars[-idtrain,]
```


### Cross validation with 4 folds for random forest model, using centered and scaled variables and train-test distribution for all folds with 70-30% using parallel processing.
```{r cross validation, echo =T }
model_doc <- "model.RData"
if (!file.exists(model_doc)) {

    # Parallel cores  
    ncores <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)
    registerDoParallel(cores=ncores)
    getDoParWorkers() # 3    
    
    # use Random Forest method with Cross Validation, 4 folds
    model <- train(classe ~ .
                , data = train
                , method = "rf"
                , metric = "Accuracy"  # categorical outcome variable so choose accuracy
                , preProcess=c("center", "scale") # attempt to improve accuracy by normalising
                , trControl=trainControl(method = "cv"
                                        , number = 4 # folds of the training data
                                        , p= 0.70
                                        , allowParallel = TRUE 
#                                       , seeds=NA # don't let workers set seed 
                                        )
                )

    save(model, file = "model.RData")
    stopCluster(ncores)
} else {
    # Use cached model  
    load(file = model_doc, verbose = TRUE)
}
```

### in sample model results
```{r model results, echo =T }
print(model, digits=4)
```

## Model results
The best model has an in sample accuracy of 0.9888 where mtry was 27 and number of trees 500.
The out of sample accuracy of the best model was 0.9947 resulting in an out of sample error of 0.00526763 and an OOB of 0.79%.

### out of sample model results
```{r testing model, echo =T }
pred <- predict(model, newdata=test)
confusionMatrix(pred, as.factor(test$classe))
```

### expected out of sample error
```{r out of sample error, echo =T }
1 - confusionMatrix(pred, as.factor(test$classe))$overall['Accuracy']
```

### final model results
```{r final model, echo =T }
model$finalModel
```

### importances of model predictiors
```{r importances, echo =T }
varImp(model)
```

### predictions for 20 cases for the test
```{r predictions, echo =T }
print(predict(model, newdata=predictiondata))
```
